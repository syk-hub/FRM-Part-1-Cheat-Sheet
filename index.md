## ðŸ“Œ One-Sample t-Test (Comparing Sample Mean to Population Mean)

The formula for a **one-sample t-test**:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$

where:
- \( \bar{X} \) = sample mean  
- \( \mu_0 \) = population mean  
- \( s \) = sample standard deviation  
- \( n \) = sample size  
- **Degrees of freedom**: \( df = n - 1 \)

## ðŸ“Œ Two-Sample t-Test (Comparing Two Independent Means)

### **Equal Variance Assumed (Pooled t-Test)**
$$
t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{S_p^2 \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right) }}
$$

where:
$$
S_p^2 = \frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}
$$
